## Dude, whatcha doin' here?
Oh, just brushing up on React basics via the official [React documentation Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), which is a simple project that:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

## Yeah, what else?
Upon completion of the basic follow-along tutorial, these improvements are suggested as challenges to complete on your own, in order of increasing difficulty:
1. ~~Display the location for each move in the move history list.~~ **_[DONE]_**
2. ~~Bold the currently selected item in the move list.~~ **_[DONE]_**
3. ~~Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.~~ **_[DONE]_**
4. ~~Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.~~ **_[DONE]_**
5. ~~When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.~~ **_[DONE]_**
6. ~~When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.~~ **_[DONE]_**

## You're not stopping there are ya?
Nope - Additional enhancements I could try:
- ~~Reset button~~ **_[DONE]_**
- ~~Add media queries to make it responsive~~ **_[DONE]_**
- Allow tracking multiple game results between two players **[IN PROGRESS]**
- Sound effects or other animation when a game ends
- Use a data viz library (eg., nivo) to show a pie or bar chart with player 1 vs player 2 results
- Deploy it live and add it to my portfolio
- Refactor index.js into multiple child component files since it's turned into a hot mess
