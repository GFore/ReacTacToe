Sample project to learn React via the official [React documentation Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) by building a tic-tac-toe game that:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

Upon completion of the basic follow-along tutorial, these improvements are suggested as challenges to complete on your own, in order of increasing difficulty:
1. Display the location for each move in the move history list. **[DONE]**
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list. **[DONE]**
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. **[DONE]**
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
