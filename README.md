## Dude, whatcha doin' here?
Oh, just brushing up on React basics via the official [React documentation Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), which is a simple project that:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

## Yeah, what else?
Upon completion of the basic follow-along tutorial, these improvements are suggested as challenges to complete on your own, in order of increasing difficulty:
1. Display the location for each move in the move history list. **[DONE THAT]**
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list. **[DONE THAT]**
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. **[DONE THAT]**
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. **[DONE THAT]**
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win. **[DONE THAT]**
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw. **[DONE THAT]**

## You're not stopping there are ya?
Nope - Possible enhancements include:
- Add media queries to make it responsive
- Deploy it live and add it to my portfolio
- Allow tracking multiple game results between two players
- Sound effects or other animation when a game ends
- Reset button **[DONE THAT]**
